## Introduction
In this Zenodo project, two versions of the online visual and auditory statistical learning tasks are offered.

- **Local**
- **Remote**

If you are intersted in running the study locally and save all data on your computer, then please refer to the **Local** section below. However, if you are interested in running the study through websites online and save all data on a remote server, please refer to the **Remote** section below.

## Local


#### The local version of the SL tasks will allow you to:

1. Use a R script to run the SL tasks on your computer. This is realized by setting up your computer as a local server. The SL tasks are still presented through a browser window (**Google Chrome is the recommended browser**), but the materials of the study (e.g. stimuli, task scripts) are stored locally.

2. Save the data of the SL tasks on your computer.



#### The local version of the SL tasks will require you to:

1. Run a R script and download a R package called `jspsychr` (https://github.com/CrumpLab/jspsychr). `jspsychr`, provided by Matt Crump, is a R package for "writing and running `jspsych` experiments using R studio". `jspsych` is a javascript library for web-based behavioral experiments written by Josh De Leeuw (https://www.jspsych.org/). As our tasks are originally designed to be run remotely, we developed the task scripts using `jspsych`. Thus, a package like `jspsychr` allows us to completely replicate the use of `jspsych` and the remote SL tasks in a local environment.

2. Download folders that contain the SL task stimuli, SL task scripts, and a R script for running the SL tasks.



#### How does the local version of the SL tasks work?

First, please download the `local` folder. This folder should contain four sub-folders:

- sslR (for the syllable SL task)
- tslR (for the tone SL task)
- lslR (for the letter SL task)
- vslR (for the image SL task)

In each `local/xslR` folder, you should find these sub-folders or files:

- data (where the data of the SL tasks should be saved)
- experiment (where the task scripts and stimuli are)
- run.R (the R script to run the SL task)

In each `local/xslR/experiment` folder, you should find these main things:

- `index.html` (the main script of the SL task)
- `jspsych` library package
- `jspsychr` script in the `jspsychr` folder
- task-specific image or sound stimuli
- `continue.html` (the end page of each experiment)

To run the study, please open `run.R`. This script is adpated from the `jspsychr` package provided by  Matt Crump (https://github.com/CrumpLab/jspsychr/blob/master/R/run_locally.R). 

To run the script, please first install the `jspsychr` package (https://github.com/CrumpLab/jspsychr) using the following commands in R. When you are installing `CrumpLab/jspsychr`, you might be asked to update some packages. 

(Note: During our tests in multiple versions of R and RStudio, we have found that the `run.R` script still worked even if we skipped all the updates. However, if you run into errors running the `run.R` script, we recommend checking the `jspsychr` github page (https://github.com/CrumpLab/jspsychr) to troubleshoot.)

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CrumpLab/jspsychr")
```
During our tests of the `run.R` script, we found that the package `lifecycle` is also needed. The version of this package must be 0.2.0. Please use the commands below to check the version of the package or update/ install the new version (0.2.0) of `lifecycle`:

```{r}
packageVersion("lifecycle") 
install.packages("lifecycle")
```

Then please run the following command. This is a customized function adpated from  (https://github.com/CrumpLab/jspsychr/blob/master/R/run_locally.R). `participant_id` is added into this customized script so that a customized ID can be assigned to each participant's data.

```{r}
run_locally <-
  function(path,
           jspsychr_host,
           jspsychr_port,
           show_in,
           participant_id) {
    pr <- plumber::plumber$new()
    
    static_site <- file.path(path, "experiment")
    data_folder <- file.path(path, "data")
    static_router <- plumber::PlumberStatic$new(static_site)
    
    pr$mount("/", static_router)
    
    # Function to save data locally
    pr$handle("POST", "/submit", function(req, res) {
      dat <- jsonlite::fromJSON(req$postBody)
      dat <- readr::read_csv(dat$filedata)
      #tsp <- get_timestamp()
      #file_id <- paste("data", get_timestamp(), get_alphanumeric(10), sep = "_")
      part_id <- participant_id
      dat$part_id <- part_id
      dat <- dat[, c(ncol(dat), 1:ncol(dat) - 1), drop = FALSE]
      readr::write_csv(dat, file.path(data_folder, paste0(part_id, "_ssl", ".csv")))
    })
    
    # add message, and options to display in viewer or browser
    message(
      paste(
        "Point the browser to http://",
        jspsychr_host,
        ":",
        jspsychr_port,
        "?subject=",
        participant_id,
        sep = ""
      )
    )
    
    if (show_in == "viewer") {
      viewer <- getOption("viewer")
      viewer(
        paste(
          "http://",
          jspsychr_host,
          ":",
          jspsychr_port,
          "?subject=",
          participant_id,
          "_ssl",
          sep = ""
        )
      )
    }
    if (show_in == "browser")
      utils::browseURL(
        paste(
          "http://",
          jspsychr_host,
          ":",
          jspsychr_port,
          "?subject=",
          participant_id,
          "_ssl",
          sep = ""
        )
      )
    
    pr$run(swagger = FALSE,
           host = jspsychr_host,
           port = jspsychr_port)
  }
```

To start running the experiment, please run the following command. You need to change the  path to your `local/xslR` folder and enter a customized participant ID. The data file will be named as "participantID_xsl.csv" and will be saved in the `local/xslR/data` folder. 


```{r}
run_locally(
  # Change the path to your local/xslR folder. Please include "". (e.g. "/Users/username/Downloads/local/sslR")
  path = "the path to your local/xslR folder",
  # Host defaults to 127.0.0.1 No need to change, but can be customized (see https://www.rplumber.io/ for more details)
  jspsychr_host = "127.0.0.1",
  # Port defaults to 8000 Don't need to change, but can be customized (see https://www.rplumber.io/ for more details)
  jspsychr_port = 8000,
  # Whehter the experiment should be shown in a browser window or the viewer in R. "browser" for browser, and "viewer" for R viewer.
  show_in = "browser",
  # Enter a customized participant ID. Please include "" . (e.g. "test")
  participant_id = "enter your ID"
)
```

After you run the the command, you should see a browser window pop up. The link of the website should be `http://127.0.0.1:8000/?subject=your_customized_id`. **Now, the experiment is ready!** The browser recommended is **Google Chrome**. For best user experience, we highly recommend you use **Google Chrome** (https://www.google.com/chrome/). If other browsers are used, the stimuli may not be displayed correctly. You can copy the link (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/?subject=your_customized_id`) to a Google Chrome browser if the command below opens other default browsers.

Now, please use the browser and get to the end of the experiment. Data will be saved as "participantID_xsl.csv" in the `local/xslR/data` folder. The participantID will be the customized ID specified in the command above.

After the experiment is finished, you can close the browser window. **And then** you can stop the above command in R by manually pressing the `stop` button in your R console. After the command is terminated, the local server will be down, and the website (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/?subject=your_customized_id`) will also show **This site canâ€™t be reached**. To run the SL task again, you can repeat the steps above.

You may see some warnings in your R console after the command is terminated. For example, there might be a warning about `plumber`. The deprecated version of `plumber` is used as this is used in the `jspsychr` package:

```{r}
Warning message:
`plumber` is deprecated as of plumber 1.0.0.
Please use `Plumber` instead. 
```

At the end of the `run.R` script, you should also find the command below. This command also works. It uses the `jspsychr` library directly, though it generates a slightly different link (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`). If you use this command instead, the data file will not be saved with a customized ID. It will be saved with date and time.

```{r}
# This also works. It uses the "jspsychr" library directly, but the name of the data file will not be saved with a customized ID. It will be saved with date and time.
# As the function name (run_locally) is the same as above, you will need to clear your R environment if you run both commands.
library(jspsychr)
run_locally(
  path = "the path to your local/xslR folder",
  show_in = "browser",
  jspsychr_host = "127.0.0.1",
  jspsychr_port = 8000
)
```
